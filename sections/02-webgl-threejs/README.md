Welcome to my code repository for the **Three.js Journey** course. This project tracks my progress as I master WebGL and 3D web development.

## 🎓 Lesson 02: What is WebGL and why use Three.js

This lesson dives into the core technology behind 3D on the web (WebGL) and explains why Three.js is the industry standard for abstracting its complexity.

### 📌 Key Takeaways
- **WebGL Defined**: A JavaScript API that renders triangles at high speed using the GPU.
- **The Complexity**: Native WebGL requires managing shaders, matrices, and thousands of lines of code to draw simple shapes.
- **Three.js Role**: A library that sits on top of WebGL, simplifying scene creation, lights, and materials into manageable objects.
- **Ecosystem**: Created by [Mr.doob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob), it has monthly updates, vast documentation, and a huge community.
